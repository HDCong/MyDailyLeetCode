# My Daily LeetCode

This is my daily challenge to improve my skill in programming, algorithm and data structure 

Begin in Jun 6th, 2020

## Day 1
Let's begin with easy level 
Actually, i'm not good at algorithm, so i decided to start from easy level to get more motivated

### Problem 1: Climbing Stairs
Such a classic problem
If take 1 step, there are n-1 steps left
If take 2 step, there are n-2 steps left
We notice that, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), this is the same as fibonacci number
The base solution is n=1, there is 1 step, n =2 => 2 steps

* Use recursion to solve this will take the O(2^n) complexity
* Improve this by dynamic programming, take O(N) complexity
* And in my Discrete mathematics subject, the recursion expression above can be solve
